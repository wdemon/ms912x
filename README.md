# ms912x driver for Linux

There are two variants:
 - VID/PID is 534d:6021. Device is USB 2
 - VID/PID is 345f:9132. Device is USB 3

For kernel 6.1 checkout branch kernel-6.1

TODOs:

- Detect connector type (VGA, HDMI, etc...)
- More resolutions
- Error handling
- Is RGB to YUV conversion needed?
